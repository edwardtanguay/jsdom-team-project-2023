title::SPA1 Exam 001: Create product box that changes style on button click
descriptionMarkdown::[[
- create and style a box that displays a product with a **buy** button
	- use any product image, or use [this book](https://edwardtanguay.vercel.app/customImages/techBooks/practicalJamstack.jpg)
- when the user clicks the buy button, change the style of the box to indicate this
- the new style should indicate to the user that the user has bought the product, e.g.
	- highlight around the image
	- add a text that says "purchased"
	- change background color
- **CHALLENGE**: when the buy button is clicked, replace it with a button "remove from cart"
	- clicking "remove from cart" resets all styles and displays the "buy" button again
