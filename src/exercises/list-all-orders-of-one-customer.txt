title::List all orders of one customer
descriptionMarkdown::[[
- you will need to import the `customers.json`, the `orders.json` and `products.json`files
- define a variable to hold a **customer id**, e.g.
```
const customerID = 'TORTU';
```
- display the **customer name**
- under the customer's name, display **all the orders** for that customer
- test your solution in that you change the `customerID` variable and see that a different **customer name** and different **orders** appear
