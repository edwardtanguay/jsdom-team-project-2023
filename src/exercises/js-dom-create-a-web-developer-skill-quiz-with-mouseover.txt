title::JS-DOM: Create a web-developer-skill quiz with mouseover
descriptionMarkdown::[[
- import this file as array of skill items: [skills.json](https://github.com/WD23-D04/jsdom-team-project/blob/dev/src/data/other/skills.json) 
- select 5 random items from the skills array
- display them on the screen so the user only sees the skill
- when the user hovers their mouse over the skill name, they should see the description
- when the user's mouse leaves the skill name, the description should be hidden again
- keep a log of the total amount of many times the user hovered over skill items
	- note that this logging is not possible if you use the CSS hover command
	- this is why you have to produce the hover effect with JavaScript
