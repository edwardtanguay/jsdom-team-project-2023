descriptionMarkdown::[[
- pretend it's 1999 and you want to get a user's name on a website
- use the **windows.prompt** command to ask for their name
- if the user enters an empty name, prompt them again
- if the user enters e.g. the name "Jim", display the following text on the page:
```
Hello Jim,

While the window.prompt command is still available in web development,  
its usage has become less common, especially in modern web applications. 

The reason for its declining usage is that it doesn't provide a good user 
experience in modern web applications. Web developers tend to use more 
advanced and user-friendly methods of collecting user input, such as HTML 
forms, input elements, and various JavaScript libraries and frameworks. 
These alternatives offer more flexibility and control over the user interface, 
and they can be styled and integrated more seamlessly into web applications.

Additionally, window.prompt can be perceived as intrusive and is often associated 
with older, less user-friendly web applications. Its use is discouraged for creating 
modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.
