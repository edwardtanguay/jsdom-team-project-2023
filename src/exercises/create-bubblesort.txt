title::Create bubblesort
descriptionMarkdown::[[
- create an array of numbers called `nums` in non-sorted order
- display them on the page, the numbers as red
- sort nums with the `sort()` function and save the result to `sortedNums`
- display `sortedNums` on the page in green
- create a bubblesort algorithm function (search Google or ask ChatGPT), and sort `nums` with the bubble sort function to a variable called `bsSortedNums`
- display `bsSortedNums` on the page in green as well
- make sure that `sort()` and your bubblesort function sort the numbers correctly and in the same order
